lstm_sentiment_analysis
=============================

TensorFlow Project
----------------------

This repository hosts all of the work for a sentiment analysis project, using TensorFlow.

The goal of this project was to build and optimize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for the purpose of predicting binary movie rating sentiment from the text of movie reviews.

This project is an exploration of what it takes to develop a sentiment analysis model from raw text data, through the full machine learning pipeline, until an accurate model is created.

I will begin by learning my way around the TensorFlow library, through observing the results of different model architectures by using a toy dataset. Then, I will pull in real data and transform it for use in the neural network. Finally, I will tune the model to search for the most accurate predictor, given the dataset.
